# rollingcat
It is a 2D level editor for rollingsky.  
The archive function of this editor is still updated. Please do not close the software if necessary.  
The author's code ability is very weak, and the editor has only one main program.  
Use the position of the first row to edit the current position, and click the "ä¸‹" button to edit the next row.  
Place the mouse over the corresponding switching module and click move left or right to switch the floor.  
If your level is edited, you need to place a row of end signs, otherwise the level may not load normally.
